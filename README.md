# Basic Rules:
* King, Assassin, 2 Knights, and 2 Ninjas
* Two locations, players randomly split up at start of game
* During the day you can trade/reveal roles with someone in your location (if they accept).
* During the night - Nothing right now, coming soon.
* During the vote phase you must vote for a player to leave your location.
  * If you don't vote, you will randomly vote once timer is finished
  * Ties are broken randomly if more then one person has the highest votes
  * End of vote phase a player from each location will swap rooms
* Game is played over 3 rull rounds
* At the end of the last rounds vote phase (after the swap), if the King and Assassin are in the same room, Ninjas win. Otherwise, Knights win.

Grey roles will be coming soon, as well as more special roles.
